                "One morning, As Gregor Samsa woke from a fitful dream filled sleep, he found that he had changed into
                an enourmous beg bug. As he lay there on his back which resembled an enourmous breastplate, by raising
                his head slightly he could see his brown protuding belly made up of a series of rigid, arched segments,
                from the top of which his bedcovers were about to slip at any moment. His tiny legs- which, compared
                with his otherwie considerable girth, were pitifully thin- flapped around helplessly as he looked on"

                Between the four familiar walls, his room, a rather small but undeniably human bedroom, was still there,
                as tranquil as ever. Above the table over which was scattered a bundle of fabric samples- Samsa was a
                commercial traveller- hung a picture that he had cut out of a fashion periodical and put in an
                attractive gilt frame. It was of a woman wearing a fur hat and fur boa, sitting very upright and showing
                off her furr muff into which her forearms disappeared.

            "Why don't I keep sleeping for a little while longer and forget all this foolishness," he thought. But this
            was entirely impractical, for he was used to sleeping on his right side, and in his present state he
            couldn't get himself into this position. No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he always
            rolled again onto his back. He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so that he would not
            have to see the wriggling legs, and gave up only when he began to feel a light, dull pain in his side which
            he had never felt before.

            "O God," he thought, "what a demanding job I've chosen! Day in, day out, on the road. The stresses of
            selling are much greater than the work going on at head office, and, in addition to that, I have to cope
            with the problems of travelling, the worries about train connections, irregular bad food, temporary and
            constantly changing human relationships which never come from the heart. To hell with it all!" He felt a
            slight itching on the top of his abdomen. He slowly pushed himself on his back closer to the bed post so
            that he could lift his head more easily, found the itchy part, which was entirely covered with small white
            spots—he did not know what to make of them and wanted to feel the place with a leg. But he retracted it
            immediately, for the contact felt like a cold shower all over him.

                He slid back again into his earlier position. "This getting up early," he thought, "makes a man quite
                idiotic. A man must have his sleep. Other travelling salesmen live like harem women. For instance, when
                I come back to the inn during the course of the morning to write up the neces- sary orders, these
                gentlemen are just sitting down to breakfast. If I were to try that with my boss, I'd be thrown out on
                the spot. Still, who knows whether that mightn't be really good for me? If I didn't hold back for my
                parents' sake, I'd have quit ages ago.

                I would've gone to the boss and told him just what I think from the bottom of my heart. He would've
                fallen right off his desk! How weird it is to sit up at that desk and talk down to the employee from way
                up there. The boss has trouble hearing, so the employee has to step up quite close to him. Anyway, I
                haven't completely given up that hope yet. Once I've got together the money to pay off my parents' debt
                to him—that should take another five or six years—I'll do it for sure. Then I'll make the big break. In
                any case, right now I have to get up. My train leaves at five o'clock."

                He looked over at the alarm clock ticking away by the chest of draw- ers. "Good God!" he thought. It was
                half past six, and the hands were go- ing quietly on. It was past the half hour, already nearly quarter
                to. Could the alarm have failed to ring? One saw from the bed that it was properly set for four o'clock.
                Certainly it had rung. Yes, but was it possible to sleep through that noise which made the furniture
                shake? Now, it's true he'd not slept quietly, but evidently he'd slept all the more deeply. Still, what
                should he do now? The next train left at seven o'clock. To catch that one, he would have to go in a mad
                rush. The sample collection wasn't packed up yet, and he really didn't feel particularly fresh and
                active.

        <p class="text appear" id="para20"> And even if he caught the train, there was no avoiding a blow-up with the
            boss, because the firm's errand boy would've waited for the five o'clock train and reported the news of his
            absence long ago. He was the boss's minion, without backbone or intelligence. Well then, what if he re-
            ported in sick? But that would be extremely embarrassing and suspi- cious, because during his five years'
            service Gregor hadn't been sick even once. The boss would certainly come with the doctor from the health
            insurance company and would reproach his parents for their lazy son and cut short all objections with the
            insurance doctor's comments; for him everyone was completely healthy but really lazy about work. And
            besides, would the doctor in this case be totally wrong? Apart from a really excessive drowsiness after the
            long sleep, Gregor in fact felt quite well and even had a really strong appetite.

            As he was thinking all this over in the greatest haste, without being able to make the decision to get out
            of bed—the alarm clock was indicat- ing exactly quarter to seven—there was a cautious knock on the door by
            the head of the bed.

        <p class="text appear" id="para22">The soft voice! Gregor was startled when he heard his voice answering. It was
            clearly and unmistakably his earlier voice, but in it was intermingled, as if from below, an irrepress- ibly
            painful squeaking, which left the words positively distinct only in the first moment and distorted them in
            the reverberation, so that one didn't know if one had heard correctly. Gregor wanted to answer in de- tail
            and explain everything, but in these circumstances he confined him- self to saying, "Yes, yes, thank you
            mother. I'm getting up right away." Because of the wooden door the change in Gregor's voice was not really
            noticeable outside, so his mother calmed down with this explanation and shuffled off.
